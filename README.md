# GoogleMeetsRaid
Created to brute force random codes into Google Meets in order to raid random Google Meets meetings.

This code was created for Java and will not work with anything else!
In order to run this code using java, Selenium must be used, along with a Google Chrome driver.
This code needs a IDE to work. 
The main code was created 100% by Henry Prince
As the code uses brute force, it takes a while, therefore please be patient.
Feel free to modify the code, but DO NOT claim it as your own.
Be safe, and be responsible!
